# Service-Status

The "Service-Status" section is used to show all connected Trubudget services, their versions and connection quality. The Status page shows every service which is meant to be connected. The check what services shall be connected is done on login. So note if a service shall be connected but isn't, the status page shows the servicec as "not connected", but if a service is not meant to be connected, the status page is never going to show this service.

## Service-Status and Versions

The core/mandatory Trubudget set consists of 4 different components (Frontend, API, Blockchain, Multichain). Trubudget also offers a set of optional services (e.g. Email-notification, excel-export). All of these services have their own version which can be viewed on the status page in the frontend.
