# Architecture Decision Records

An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.
For more information about what an ADR is visit the [Architecture decision record project](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record) on GitHub.

Following table shows a list of TruBudget's ADRs:
